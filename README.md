=========================

Allows you to enable or disable debugging over Wi-Fi from within the device,
without a USB cable. This can come in handy if your USB cable broke or you
lost/forgot it somewhere.

**Note**: While this app doesn't require root permissions, it seems to not
work on non-rooted devices, and I'm not sure it can. If you find a solution
for this, let me know!
