Wirebug ![Logo](icon.png)
=========================

Allows you to enable or disable debugging over Wi-Fi from within the device,
without a USB cable. This can come in handy if your USB cable broke or you
lost/forgot it somewhere.

**Note:** Wirebug needs root permissions to write to the `system.adb.tcp.port`
property as well as to restart the ADB daemon. Thus it will work only with
rooted devices.
